                <h2>Top Blogs For Friends: 10 Must Read Friendship Sites </h2>The blogs that follow aren’t all straight up friendship sites. They weave through related topics like community, relationship-building and putting people first. Some of the authors
                toss out opinions I don’t agree with (but who do we really agree with on everything?) and some of them bravely slosh around in topics I would be banished to Iceland before blogging about, but all of them have something smart, meaningful
                or savvy to say about how relationships work.</p>
